ddl changes:

	*	by Daniel on 12/03:

		-	'date' in birth & death seperated into 'year', 'month', 'day' (because some sources know only some of those parts)
		-	removed 'occupation_id' for person (since there is the 'person_occupation' table to model that relation)
		-	added 'person.degree', 'person.twitter', 'person.education', 'politician.aw_picture_url' (missing from aw)
		-	corrected 'candidacy'-pk from 'candidate' to 'candidate', 'parliament' & 'constituency'

	*	by Daniel on 12/04:

		-	'latitude' & 'longitude' in 'place' converted to VARCHAR (format is like 'E007.133333', that's not real)

	*   by Jakob on 12/08:
	
	    -   add another entity 'country'
		-   add relation 'person_country' for a person's nationality (mapped from wikidata)
		-   rename 'place.country' to 'place.country_id' and make it a FK reference to 'country.id'
		-   add 'state.country_id' for completeness sake

	*	by Daniel on 12/09:

		-	removed 'constituency' from 'candidacy' primary key (becaue that's not by bundesrat/bundestag)
		-	added 'id' column for 'state' & 'committee' since using the name as pk does not work when combining multiple data sources
		-	moved 'state_id' from 'politician' to 'candidacy'
